## 🔐 Incident 1: SSH Brute-Force Attempt
### Detect multiple failed SSH login attempts
index=* "sshd" "Failed password"

#### 🔐 (Optional Enhancement)
 Group failed logins by IP to detect brute-force patterns
index=* "sshd" "Failed password" 
| stats count by src_ip, user 
| where count > 5

## 🔐 Incident 2: Blocked RDP Port Access
### Detect RDP connection attempts blocked by the firewall
index=* "firewall: Connection" "BLOCKED" "port 3389"

## ⚠️ Incident 3: Suspicious Command Execution
### Look for risky command usage such as wget, curl, or sudo
index=* ("wget" OR "curl" OR "sudo")

## 👀 Incident 4: Multiple Successful Logins from Same IP
### Find successful logins to different accounts from the same IP
index=* "sshd" "Accepted password"
| stats count by src_ip, user 
| where count > 2

## 🌐 Incident 5: Unusual Port Access Attempts
### Find access attempts to non-standard ports
index=* "BLOCKED" OR "Connection" AND (port!=80 AND port!=443)

 📈 Bonus: Repeated Login Failures (by user or IP)
index=* "Failed password"
| stats count by user, src_ip 
| where count > 3

### 🚨 Bonus: Detect sudo command activity
index=* "sudo"

### 🧪 Bonus: Monitor All Authentication Events
index=* "sshd"

### 🔍 Bonus: Keyword-based search for common attack tools
index=* ("nmap" OR "hydra" OR "netcat")

### ⚠️ Bonus: Track any elevated command executions
index=* "COMMAND="

### ✅ General Log Review (for debugging or baseline)
index=* 
| table _time, host, source, sourcetype, _raw 
| sort -_time
